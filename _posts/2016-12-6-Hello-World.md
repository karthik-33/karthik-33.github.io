This is my first blog post, ever. I was told that blogging about my data science projects (aka "building a portfolio") would be a good way to show work examples to prospective employers. I suppose that sounds reasonable, so here I am.

I have lived in both the academic world and the 'real' world, and both have somewhat different writing styles that I've experienced (I have a couple of journal publications from my grad school days, and a number of internal company publications at GE). Blogging is distinct from either of these, and is definitely about bringing out the 'you' in your posts.

My style is going to start off as a mixture of the academic and industry worlds ... which may sometimes be painful to read, but I promise to make it worth your while with clear (and succint) thought processes, lots of visualizations and solid conclusions.

Happy reading!
