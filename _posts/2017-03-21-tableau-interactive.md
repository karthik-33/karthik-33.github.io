I wanted to post a couple of interactive Tableau charts from previous projects here to provide additional insights. The mechanics for accomplishing this are fairly straightforward - save the worksheet to Tableau Public using the "Server" dropdown menu on the Tableau Desktop, and use the shareable link provided on <a href="https://public.tableau.com"><font color="008000"><b>Tableau Public</b></font></a> to embed the chart in the blog post using an iframe tag.

#### Airport delays

See <a href="https://karthik-33.github.io/FAA-flight-delays"><font color="008000"><b>FAA Airport flight delays</b></font></a> for the original post on this topic. The chart below shows % on-time departures for various airports in the continental USA from 2004-2014, based on FAA data. Small airports in the vicinity of the largest airports (by annual traffic volume) showed the worst on-time departure rates.

#### Caterpillar tube assembly pricing

See <a href="https://karthik-33.github.io/capstone"><font color="008000"><b>Predict pricing for Caterpillar tube assemblies used in Caterpillar equipment </b></font></a> for the original post on this topic. The chart below shows the effect of the number of CP-26 components in a tube assembly on quoted price, as a function of quoted quantity of tube assemblies. Also available in the tooltip are tube assembly wall thickness and diameter - additional factors that affect quoted price.
